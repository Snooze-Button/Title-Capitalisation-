# Title-Capitalisation-
Simple project to capitalise words by taking in string as a input and outputing the result with correct capitalisation.

## Scenario 
Many wriiters are often confused by the different methods of capitalising titles. There are several forms of capitalisation rules but one of the most popular is called "title case" or "up style". Implement a solution that will take a title in form of a string and return the string with the corerct capitalization for a title according to these rules. 

<ol>
  <li>Always capitalize the first word in a title.
    <li>Always capitalize the last word in a title.
      <li>Lowercase the following word unless they are the first or last word of the title: "a" , "the" , "to", "at", "in", "with", "and", "but", "or".
 </ol>
 
 A word is defined as a series of non-space characters.
 
 **Example 1:** "i love solving problems and it is fun"
 Would return "I Love Solving Problems and It Is Fun"
 
 **Example 2:** "wHy DoeS A biRd Fly?"
 Would return "Why Does a Bird Fly?"
